# Natural Language Processing on Chatbot Dataset

A dataset containing user queries is provided. Each query is tagged by humans with single/multiple (all the applicable domains) domains. The task is to build a multi-label classifier using this training data. The classifier should tag all the possible domains for each query. You can find dataset here. (We put the data but we are yet to put the full description file in the data)
Classes: food, support(home services), reminders, movies, nearby, travel, recharge, casual, other
Evaluation Criteria:  
 There are two evaluation metric for this assignment
1: Classwise(k) precision and recall (True: class k is identified correctly)
2: Overall accuracy (True: All the classes are correctly identified for given record) (Baseline accuracy: 70%, expected accuracy > 80%)
